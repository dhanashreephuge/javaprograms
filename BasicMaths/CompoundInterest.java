// A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
// P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
// r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
// n = the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t
// t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for

// The above formula gives the total amount. To find the compound interest use,

// Compound Interest = A â€“ P
